# Infinite-Scroll

- The Unsplash API is utilized here to create a semmleslly infinite scroll event by loading pictures from the API. Nothing fancy, just trying it out!	:grin:

## Feature

- INFINITE SCROLL!!! Have i mentioned that? Yeah, but it's really not infinite because the Unsplash API has a limit to how much request it can accept per hour so if someone has alreadly used it to reach it's limit, tough luck! Try the next hour.
- You'll also love the loading animation especially if your internet speed is slow.
- Click the image you want to fully see or download, it will redirect you to the unsplash page.
